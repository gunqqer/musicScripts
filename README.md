A set of scripts I use for music

# Scripts
## sort.sh
takes two absolute paths to directories. The first is the input directory, second being output. It will sort music files by $OUTPUT/$artist/$album/. You may want to adjust the amount of logical threads used for gnu/parallel with its -j argument.

## art.sh
tries to use w3mimgdisplay to display album art in a terminal. It isn't very good, doesn't work with virtual desktops being switched. 

## viu.sh
is the better album art in terminals script. Lower resolution but the picture is actually being displayed in the terminal.
